	Planar Cable Manipulator Dynamics Analysis

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:

1-FD_sim.m          This program solves the forward dynamics of 
                    the planar cable manipulator: variable mass approach
                    using implicit Newton-Euler formulation for 
                    a typical trajectory.
 
Sub routines:
1-TP_cubic.m		This program generates a cubic trajectory for the 
                    manipulator.

To execute the program just run FD_sim function in Matlab.
