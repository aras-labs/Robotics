	Planar Cable Manipulator Dynamics Analysis

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:

1-FD_sim.m          This program This program solves the forward dynamics 
                    of the planar cable manipulator using implicit 
                    Newton-Euler formulation for a typical trajectory.

   
Sub routines:
1-ID_4RPR.M
        This program generates the implicit Newton-Euler formulation 
        of the planar cable manipulator.

To execute the program just run FD_sim function in Matlab.
