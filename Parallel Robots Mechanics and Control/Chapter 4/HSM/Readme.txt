	Chapter Four	Hydraulic Shoulder Manipulator

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:
1-singularity_HSM.m     
            This program verifies the singularity free workspace of 
            the shoulder manipulator
Sub routines:
1-Jacobian_HSM		
            This program generates the Jacobian Matrix of the
			Shoulder Manipulator
2-InvKin_HSM		
            This program solves the inverse kinematics of the
			Shoulder Manipulator
