	Stewart-Gough Manipulator

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:
1-verification_analyical.m	
	This program executes the inverse and forward kinematics (Analytical method) of 	the 6-6p Stewart-Gough Manipulator and verifies the results
			
Sub routines:
1-TP_cubic		This program generates a cubic trajectory for the manipulator

2-Inv_Kin_4RRR		This program solves the inverse kinematics of the
			planar cable manipulator
3- FK_4RRR		This program solves the forward kinematics of the
			planar cable manipulator

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To execute the program just run Inv_Fkin in Matlab.
