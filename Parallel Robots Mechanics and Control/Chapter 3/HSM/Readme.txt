	Hydraulic Shoulder Manipulator

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:
1-verification_HSM.m	This program executes the inverse and forward kinematics 
			of the Shoulder Manipulator and verifies the results
Sub routines:
1-TP_cubic		This program generates a cubic trajectory for the manipulator

2-InvKin_HSM		This program solves the inverse kinematics of the
			Shoulder Manipulator
3-FK_HSM		This program solves the forward kinematics of the
			Shoulder Manipulator

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To execute the program just run verification_HSM in Matlab.
