	Planar Cable Manipulator Kinematics

The programs used in this section are as follows:

Main program:
1-Inv_Fkin.m		This program executes the inverse and forward kinematics 
			of the planar cable manipulator and verifies the results
Sub routines:
1-TP_cubic		This program generates a cubic trajectory for the manipulator

2-Inv_Kin_4RRR		This program solves the inverse kinematics of the
			planar cable manipulator
3- FK_4RRR		This program solves the forward kinematics of the
			planar cable manipulator

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To execute the program just run Inv_Fkin in Matlab.
