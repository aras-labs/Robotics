The following programs in this folder corresponds to Chapter 5 of the book: 

Main programs:
1- Lagrange_Elbow.m	
    This code determines the Dynamic Vectors and matrices of the
    3DOF Elbow manipulator using Lagrange method and Symbolic manipulation 

Other subroutines

1-DH.m      This function Defines DH Parameters
2-SR.m      This function Defines Screw Parameters
3-Vector_Vpa.m 
        This code provides a better representation of the 
        symbolic vectors in MATLAB
4-Matrix_Vpa.m
        This code provides a better representation of the
         symbolic matrices in MATLAB
5-Matrix_Vpa_Numeric.m		
        This code provides a better representation of
        symbolic matrices that are numerically evaluated.
